# PROJECT
This project predicts used car prices using machine learning on Craigslist data. After data cleaning and analysis, multiple regression models were trained and compared. Performance was evaluated using RMSE, and Gradient Boosting achieved the lowest error, showing better accuracy for real-world price prediction.
